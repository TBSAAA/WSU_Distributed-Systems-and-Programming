There are 4 txt files, which are saved from the data obtained from the service through the shell program written by me. The file name containing local is generated by a server program written by myself. The remaining two are data returned from the school server. Through the comparison, all the data are completely consistent. The main rules are as follows

Surface and volume

    int l = (int) argp->length, h = (int) argp->height, w = (int) argp->width;

    if (l % 3 != 0)
        l = l / 3 + 1;
    else
        l = l / 3;

    if (h % 3 != 0)
        h = h / 3 + 1;
    else
        h = h / 3;

    if (w % 3 != 0)
        w = w / 3 + 1;
    else
        w = w / 3;

    result.surface = 18 * (l * h + h * w + l * w);
    result.volume = 27 * l * h * w;

Cost

    if (argp->volume == 0 || argp->mass == 0) {
        result = 0;
        return &result;
    }

    if (argp->volume < argp->mass * 9) {
        result = 3 * argp->volume;
    } else {
        result = 18 * argp->mass;
    }
